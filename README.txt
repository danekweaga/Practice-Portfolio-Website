This was gotten by using the " tree /F /A" command in command prompt.

3. Navigation Structure

Each page contains a navigation bar that links to:

- index.html
- education.html
- experience.html
- projects.html
- contact.html

Because the navigation bar appears on every page, users can move
between all pages at any time. Additionally at the bottom of each page, 
there is a link to return to the home page (index.html).
